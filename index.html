            <p>
              My research interests focus on creating a <strong>synergy between human and AI</strong>, applying interdisciplinary technology to enhance well-being both physically and spiritually. 
              I come up with engineering innovations to increase the accessibility and intuitivity of human-AI interaction in <strong>healthcare applications</strong> and <strong>social sciences</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I propose to incorporate <strong>knowlege-enhanced multidomain AI</strong> as <strong>decision support</strong> agents. I am interested in constructing reliable knowledge bases and knowledge graphs for decision supports with high <strong>interpretability and explainability</strong> in complex decision processes. 
              I am interested in leveraging advanced sensor technologies to create a <strong>comprehensive profile</strong> of the subject of interest. By integrating these diverse inputs and combining them with <strong>domain-specific knowledge</strong>, I aim to enable <strong>more informed and context-aware reasoning</strong>. 
              My focus is on utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as sensing apparatus, to deepen our understanding of subjects ranging from personal health to the preservation of valuable objects. Through the <strong>unification</strong> of sensor data and expert knowledge, I seek to enhance the overall decision-making process, offering a holistic and nuanced perspective.
              I envision working with people from different fields of expertise that can potentially benefitted from AI-aided decision supports and integrate with reliable and efficient pipelines in their workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I‚Äôm also interested in rethinking the role of AI in emotion support via <strong>affective computing</strong> and <strong>multi-sensor fusion</strong>, 
              to enable <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>self-reflection</strong> through the most <strong> natural form of personal expression</strong> and the most <strong>realistic day-to-day behaviors</strong>, which gave rise to the on-going <strong>Posture2Melody</strong> project.
              In the project, I propose to use generative AI, alongside with different modalities of physiology and psychology tracking, as the mirror onto our own understanding of music, lowering the bar for expression.
              This framework invites us to consider how <strong>AI can perceive and make-sense of human emotion overtime</strong>, enabling AI agents to deliver responses appropriately aligned with the user's emotional state. </strong>.

            I have cultivated a broad range domain experiences, spanning both natural and social sciences.
            I am proficient in developing AI algorithms, with extensive coding and programming capabilities that enable me to build AI models for diverse applications.
            I have hardware design and electrical engineering experiences for wearable devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the healthcare domain, I have worked on projects like developing a smart contact lens, <strong>OPTMISE</strong>, powered by computer vision and time-series analysis algorithms, to support the dynamic monitoring of eye physiology. 
            I also worked on developing AI algorithm for deciphering <strong>single-channel EMG</strong> signals for gesture recognition to support more accessible human-machine interaction, 
            which evolved into the project of combining EMG-decoding and <strong>transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</strong> to <strong>restore dexterous limb movements in neurodegenerative cases</strong>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In the realm of social sciences, I have applied my AI knowledge to assess educational tools in higher education settings through <strong>semantic analysis</strong>, providing insights into designing <strong>more effective online pedagogy schemes during the pandemic</strong>. 
            My work in cultural heritage conservation <strong>merges advanced computer vision algorithm</strong> for image processing with <strong>paper-based cultural artifact conservation</strong> to expedite <strong>microorganism-contamination identification</strong> in cultural heritage biodegradation. 
            I also formulated <strong>biochemical cleaning agents</strong> based on surface contaminants and bioenzymes for <strong>removing mold contaminations</strong> from fragile paper-based cultural heritage artifacts, as well as <strong>preserving and enhancing the structural integrity</strong> of the paper medium.
          </p>
          <p>I am also getting involved in developing knowledge-driven reasoning, including the construction of <strong>knowledge graphs (KG)</strong> and <strong>retrival augmented generation (RAG)</strong>, to enhance the intuitiveness of smart manufacturing processes</p>

    <br><strong>TLDR:</strong> Paper-based artifacts hold significant cultural and social values. 
    However, paper is intrinsically fragile to microorganisms, such as mold, due to its cellulose composition. Mold not only can damage papers‚Äô structural integrity and pose significant challenges to conservation works
    but also may subject individuals attending the contaminated artifacts to health risks. Current conservation practices with mold-contaminated artifacts have
    little to no pre-screening, and the cleaning techniques are
    usually broad-spectrum rather than strain-specific. This study investigated the feasibility of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for fast in-situ recognition and classification of mold on paper.<br>

    <br><strong>TLDR:</strong> The recognition of bird species through the analysis of their vocalizations is a crucial aspect of wildlife conservation and biodiversity monitoring. In this study, the acoustic features of Certhia americana, Certhia brachydactyla, and Certhia familiaris were calculated to train three machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

    <p>I am also devoted to enhance public understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have a personal education channel over <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/625a1c60000000000c036ad4">RED</a> to share bite-size knowledge of ML algorithms and AI-related techniques. I also curate a suite of ML-education repositories on Github:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ChenshuLiu/Machine-Learning-in-Python.git">Machine learning from scratch in Python</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ChenshuLiu/Machine-Learning-in-R.git">Machine learning application in R</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ChenshuLiu/Deep-Learning-with-R.git">Deep learning application in R</a></li>
    </ul>
