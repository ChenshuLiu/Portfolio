            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            <p>
                My research interests focus on creating a <strong>synergy between human and AI</strong>, applying interdisciplinary technology to enhance well-being both physically and spiritually. 
                I come up with engineering innovations to increase the <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>intuitiveness</strong> of human-AI interaction in both <strong>healthcare applications</strong> and <strong>societal enrichments</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have cultivated a broad range domain experiences, spanning both <strong>natural sciences</strong> and <strong>humanities</strong>.
                I am proficient in developing <strong>AI algorithms</strong> diverse application scenarios. The wordcloud below shows the span of my projects, fields of expertise, and techniques.
              </p>
              <img src="images/Asset 1.png" alt="research_interest" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" />
              <p>
                I propose to incorporate <strong>knowlege-enhanced multidomain AI</strong> as <strong>decision support</strong> agents. I am interested in constructing reliable knowledge bases (KB) and knowledge graphs (KG) for decision supports with high <strong>interpretability and explainability</strong> in complex decision processes. 
                I am interested in leveraging advanced <strong>sensing</strong> technologies to create a <strong>comprehensive profile</strong> of the subject of interest. By integrating these descriptive inputs and combining them with <strong>domain-specific knowledge</strong>, I aim to enable <strong>more informed and context-aware reasoning</strong>, whether for enhance patient well-being or restoring an artifact. 
                Through the <strong>unification</strong> of sensor data and expert knowledge, I seek to enhance the overall decision-making process.
                I envision working with people from different fields of expertise that can potentially benefitted from AI-aided decision supports and integrate with reliable and efficient pipelines in their workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I‚Äôm also interested in rethinking the role of AI in emotion support via <strong>affective computing</strong> and <strong>multi-sensor fusion</strong>, 
                to enable <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>self-reflection</strong> through the most <strong> natural form of personal expression</strong> and the most <strong>realistic day-to-day behaviors</strong>, which gave rise to the on-going <strong>Posture2Melody</strong> project.
                In the project, I propose to use generative AI, alongside with different modalities of physiology and psychology tracking, as the mirror onto our own understanding of music, lowering the bar for expression.
                This framework invites us to consider how <strong>AI can perceive and make-sense of human emotion overtime</strong>, enabling AI agents to deliver responses appropriately aligned with the user's emotional state. </strong>
